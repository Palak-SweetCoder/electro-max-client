## Short Description:
This is an inventory management website. Here are some inventory items with detailed information. A registered user can update the items' stock. The user can update the stocked item quantity by increasing or decreasing. Also, users can add their own items by using the add item route. Then the user can see their added item in the My Items route, and they have the ability to delete their added item.

The user can register using the Google sign-in method or the email password-based sign-in method.

There is also a route called Manage Inventories. The user will see all the inventory items there, and they can delete any item they want.
